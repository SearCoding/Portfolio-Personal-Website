            <p>
                My name is Nasir Deshields, and I am an undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.coppin.edu/"
                    target="_blank">Coppin State University</a>, majoring in
                Computer Science. I am passionate about technology, problem-solving, and innovation in the STEM fields.
                With a strong foundation in programming and analytical thinking, I strive to develop solutions that are
                efficient, impactful, and user-oriented.

                Throughout my academic journey, I have gained experience in multiple programming languages, including
                Java, C, C++, HTML, and JavaScript, and I've worked on projects involving web development, application
                design, and system analysis. I am particularly interested in backend development, data structures, and
                building scalable software systems.

                Currently, I serve as the President of the Computer Science and Mathematics Club, where I help connect
                students with internship opportunities, organize technical workshops, and foster a collaborative
                learning environment. I have also worked as a STEM tutor, assisting students in mastering core concepts
                in computer science and mathematics.

                In addition, I've participated in research and professional development programs such as the <a
                    href="https:/www.bnl.gov/" target="_blank">Brookhaven
                    National Laboratory</a> WDTS Mini-Semester, where I explored interdisciplinary science and deepened
                my
                understanding of research applications in computing.

                I am actively seeking opportunities that allow me to apply my technical knowledge, contribute to
                meaningful projects, and continue growing as a developer and leader in the field of technology.
